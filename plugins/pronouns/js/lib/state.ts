/**
 * Settings, lists and per-user overrides, in the plugin's jsonStorage.

 * Reads come from one in-memory mirror, never `jsonStorage.cache`: `get()` is async and the

 *
 * Saving: until the file has loaded, a write is a merge (so it can't wipe what's on disk); once
 * loaded, the whole mirror replaces the file. That keeps removals removed without tombstones
 * piling up (a merge `set()` can never delete a key), and is what makes the lists stick across
